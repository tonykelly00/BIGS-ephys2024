# BIGS-ephys2024
This workshop will explore the Allen dataset of 4,435 mouse cells from the visual cortex. Available data describe the cells' transcriptomes, intrinsic physiological properties, and — for a subset — morphologies.
Cells were assigned to one of the 60 transcriptomically defined cell types described in Tasic et al. 2018. Nearly all of the cells are inhibitory, but the dataset includes some excitatory cells as well. Additionally, cells with all three modalities were assigned to one of 28 interneuron met-types that have congruent morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic properties. The definition and analysis of these met-types were introduced in Integrated Morphoelectric and Transcriptomic Classification of Cortical GABAergic Cells, by Gouwens, Sorensen, et al. 20220
The aim of the workshop is to explore the questions
1) to what extent do cells within a transcriptomic type (t-types) have similar morpho-electric features?
2) to what extent do cells across different t-types have different ME features?

In short: what is are different cell types and how to define them?
