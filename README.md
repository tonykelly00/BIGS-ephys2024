# BIGS-ephys2024
This workshop will explore the Allen dataset of 4,435 mouse cells from the visual cortex found [here](https://portal.brain-map.org/cell-types/classes/multimodal-characterization/multimodal-characterization-mouse-visual-cortex). Available data describe the cells' transcriptomes, intrinsic physiological properties, and — for a subset — morphologies.
Cells were assigned to one of the 60 transcriptomically defined cell types described in Tasic et al. 2018. Nearly all of the cells are inhibitory, but the dataset includes some excitatory cells as well. Additionally, cells with all three modalities were assigned to one of 28 interneuron met-types that have congruent morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic properties. The definition and analysis of these met-types were introduced in Integrated Morphoelectric and Transcriptomic Classification of Cortical GABAergic Cells, by [Gouwens, Sorensen, et al. 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742031254X)
The aim of the workshop is to explore the questions
1) to what extent do cells within a transcriptomic type (t-types) have similar morpho-electric features?
2) to what extent do cells across different t-types have different ME features?

In short: what are different cell types and how to define them?

GABAergic interneuron class catagorised into sub-classes based on morpho-electrophysiological features

Pav cells are typically fast spiking with the canonnical example of perisomatic innervating basket cells.<br>
Sst cells are typically regular/adaptive firing with dendritic innervation pattern example of Martinotti cells.<br>
VIP cells are typically regular/adaptive firing radial projecting dendrites example of bipolar cells. <br>
Lamp5 cells are typically late spiking and neuroglial-type morphology L1 canopy and non-classical synapses example of neurogliaform cells NPY <br>
Sncg cells are typically regular/adaptive firing with translaminar axonal innervation

these cells map onto 60 transcriptomic clusters

and the 60 t-types map onto 28 MET-type
